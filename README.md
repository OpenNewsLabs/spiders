News Spiders
==========
A collection of crawlers for news web sites. This is used to grab links of the latest stories and provide them in a clean api. Most news orgs do not provide an api to get their latest stories. So I have created my own.

Local installation
--------

1. git clone
2. npm install
3. node app

Current API
--------
* /cnn
* /fox
* /bbc

Testing
--------
API tests are run using mocha. Before you run mocha you must have the API running ( step three under local installation )
